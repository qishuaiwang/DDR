!!!! IMPORTANT !!!! 
===============================================================================
For information on how to use PhyInit refer to the DWC DDRPHY PhyInit App Note
provided in the documentation package.

===============================================================================
What is PhyInit program?
===============================================================================

The purpose of the PhyInit program is to allow the user to generate a 
customized PHY initialization sequence specific to the user's system 
configuration.  The user will provide a set of configuration inputs to the
program and it will output a PHY initialization sequence specific to the inputs
provided.  The user can choose to execute or skip the training firmware in the
initialization sequence. 

Detailed information on PhyInit Software features and usage are provided in 
DWC DDRPHY PhyInit App Note.  It is recommended the user be familiar with 
DesignWare Cores PHY Utility Block (PUB) data book section on Clocks, Reset,
initialization.

PhyInit Quick Setup Guide
===============================================================================
The following instruction is designed to quickly setup PhyInit to program the 
PHY for a basic simple setup with SkipTraining in zero board delay system.

===============================================================================
1. Enter user Inputs ( Section 3.2 of PhyInit App Note)
===============================================================================
Edit the content of ./<protocol>/dwc_ddrphy_phyinit_setDefault.c according to
your specific configuration. The file is comprised of user input fields and the 
associated values divided into 3 categories:

  1. userInputBasic    - these are inputs that the user must enter information 
                         specific to their configuration.  User must replace the
                         default values in the field with their specific
                         settings.
  
  2. userInputAdvanced - these are optionally inputs. User can choose to enter 
                         new values or leave the fields at the default values.
  
  3. userInputSim      - these are inputs that the user shall enter if execution
                         of training firmware skipped.  If training firmware is 
                         executed, user can leave the fields at default.

A detailed description of each user input field can be found in this file:

   ./<protocol>/src/dwc_ddrphy_phyinit_struct.h

===============================================================================
2. Compile and Run
===============================================================================
Call the make target associated with your protocol to compile and run PhyInit:

>> cd <protocol> 
>> make FIRMWARE_PATH=<Absolute path to firmware release folder> PUB=<PHY RTL major revision>

NOTE: PhyInit looks for the firmware message block definition in
 <FIRMWARE_PATH>/<protocol>/mnPmuSramMsgBlock_<protocol>.h. Ensure this path is
provided correctly in order to compile PhyInit. The specified PUB major
revision must match with PHY RTL major revision (set PUB=1 for all PUB 1.x revisions,
set PUB=2 for all PUB 2.x revisions).
 
===============================================================================
3. Read Outputs 
===============================================================================
The output from the PhyInit program is a text file located in 
<protocol>/output/*.txt that documents the PHY initialization sequence. It 
contains comments that describe each step of the sequence and APB write commands
to PHY registers. The text files are Verilog syntax compatible.

Each dwc_ddrphy_apb_wr(addr, data) specifies the address of the register and 
data to be programmed. The user must implement their own version of 
dwc_ddrphy_apb_wr() to perform APB writes to PHY register.

It is important to perform the register programing in sequence and relative to 
other system events as described in each text file. The steps in the output file
correspond to the steps documented in the PHY Initialization section of the
PUB Databook. More information on each sequence and more advanced topics are
provided in the PhyInit App Note.

As an example the register writes along with the initialization sequence of events
for SkipTraining in zero board delay systems can be found in:
   ./<protocol>/output/dwc_ddrphy_phyinit_skip_train.txt

===============================================================================
Additional Notes
===============================================================================
- If running training firmware for multiple p-states, the user must change the 
  PHY input clock to the target frequency before executing the firmware for the 
  next PState.  Refer to Step E in PHY Initialization of PUB Databook.

- To remove output files, type "make clean"

- All source code resides in <protocol>/src and <protocol>/userCustom/ 
  directories

- The top-level file to generate phyinit executable is: 
  <protocol>/src/dwc_ddrphy_phyinit_main.c
